Whelp, you beat the Game.

You wanted to beat it and you did. 

What? Were you expecting this is be diffrent?

This Game was originally built be Mojang, decompiled and recompiled by Eagtek and brought to you by the Creators of REBLOCKED.

The first 2 supporters we give thanks, but we here wanted to be fun. 

We changed things around, made fun easter eggs, made sure this server isn't blown to Kingdom Come.

We were constantly watching, waiting, helping, and destorying the players, doing it all to you.

And you know, we never got tired of it.

Who are we? 

We created REBLOCKED, we messed around endlessly, and we created the Minecraft of VPS.

This server was created by UnknownBot, maintained by Mongoose, and many others contributed to it. 

Thank you for playing. 

Thank you for making our, and others life better. 

Thank you for being kind and not running out of kindness. 

Thank you for wasting your time as well.

But please...

Go do something useful in the world.

Go and earn back the time you wasted here. 

Go and stop playing games that are useless and spead kindness.

And don't buy Apple Products. 

Now, I stop my rant, and I hoped you learned something. 

- UNKNOWN BOT and MONGOOSE













And now for your enjoyment...



















Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see

So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

You'll never know if you don't go

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder

You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin

The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

My world's on fire, how about yours?

That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

All that glitters is gold

Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?

I need to get myself away from this place

I said, "Yup" what a concept

I could use a little fuel myself

And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running

Didn't make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

So much to do, so much to see

So what's wrong with taking the back streets?

You'll never know if you don't go (go!)

You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play

Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid

And all that glitters is gold

Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold

Only shooting stars break the mold
